This is a simple version of Pong written with Java Swing. 

The ball will bounce off the player and enemy bars at an angle proportional to the distance to the middle point of the bar. So basically, if you hit the ball flat in the middle, it'll reflect perfectly horizontal. If you hit it with the edge, it'll go nearly vertical.

Also has ball speed settings and local multiplayer support!
